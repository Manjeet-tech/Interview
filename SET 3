Coding Questions :

Create an API for Tiny URL Management

Create an API in Spring Boot that converts a long URL into a tiny URL, stores it in a database, and allows retrieving the original URL based on the tiny URL. Assume this feature is for a social media platform, e.g., Twitter, where users share URLs.

Implement session management to track URLs for each session.
How to Kill an Existing Port and Run the Application on Another Port.
Explain the steps to terminate an application running on a specific port (e.g., 8080) and reconfigure Spring Boot to use a different port.
How to Add Dump Data to a Java Application.
Describe methods to add initial (dump) data to a Java application, such as using data.sql, import.sql, ApplicationRunner, or custom data loaders.


Theoretical Questions :

ArrayList vs. Other Lists
Explain the differences between ArrayList and other list implementations in Java, such as LinkedList and Vector, with examples of when each is preferred.
String vs. StringBuilder vs. StringBuffer
Compare String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer in Java, focusing on immutability, thread-safety, and performance.
Adding Swagger Dependencies in pom.xml
List the dependencies needed to add Swagger to a Spring Boot project, and explain how to configure Swagger to document APIs.

1. What is Abstraction
2. What is inheritance and composition , difference between them
3. Class E {
  long id;
  String name;
  public E(long id, String name) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
  }

}
 
E e1 = new E(101, "e1");
E e2 = new E(101, "e1");
 
List<E> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add(e1);
boolean b = list.contains(e2);
what should you do to make b as true?

4.reverse a string using recursion,( make sure you handle NPE and all edge cases)

5.int[] a = {1,2,5,1,2,7,9}; write programs to find the repeated elements in the array

6.int[] a = {1,5,7,9}
int[] b = {2,4,8,10}
write a program to merge these two sorted arrays .

7.int[] a = {1, 5, 7, 9, 6, 3, 4}
 
find all 2 elements that can sum to 8

8.employee_manager
eid	mid
101	null
102	101
103	101
104	102
105	103
106	102
 
 
employee 
eid	name
101	E1
102 	E2
103	E3
104	E4
105	E5
106	E6

output:
E1 2
E2 2
E3 1

write sql query for getting this output.
